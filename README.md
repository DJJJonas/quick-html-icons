## How to use

<img align="right" src="./img/help.png" width="400" />

1. Click on "Font Awesome 4" or "Google", it copies a `link` tag to your clipboard
2. Paste the link tag inside the head tag of your html
3. Click on the copy button of any icon you like, it copies the `i` tag of the icon
4. Paste it in your HTML

> **Note**
> Font Awesome 4 name their icons as of what they are (e.g. a heart icon is named "fa-heart"),
> but Google name their icons as of what they do (e.g. a heart icon is name "favorite").
